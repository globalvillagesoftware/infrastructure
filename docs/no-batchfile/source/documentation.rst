Handling Terms
**************
The |gv| documentation is technical. It is filled with words that reference
concepts that are fully described externally. In addition the names of
applications and organizations are frequently found.

By convention, these terms will be displayed with visual highlighting to help
the reader understand the significance of the term.

Structure of |gv| Documentation

best structure for this documentation. This documentation is concerned with the
overall management of the |gv| environment. The two major topics are
governance of the |gv| and management of the sofware development environment.
