**********
Objectives
**********

*Global Village* configuration should, at least, support open source software
development. Any extension of this support to commercial or governmental
environments will be a distant prospect.

Ultimately, configuration will support the development and use of a variety of
programs onthe *Global Village* environment. In doing this, generality and the
possibilities of additional application areas should be kept in mind. At least
some of the developers will belong to organizations that have in-house needs
that differ ffrom those of the *Global Village*.

**********************
What is configuration?
**********************

This is the collection of data that controls the operation of organizations
through individuals to software programs that need data to determine how they
should operate. This data is computer based and should be accessible to all the
active elements involved in the development, running, and maintenance of
computer  programs. My thoughts started with computer program configuration but
it rapidly became apparent that this configuration information should support
the people involved in computer software and their activities. 

***********************
The Software Life-Cycle
***********************

A brief examination of the software development process as practiced by the
*Global Village* organization will be given here. Since the configuration must
support this process, it will help to uderstand a little of what the software
development process is all about. This is all written from the pespective of
open source software development,
