Welcome to the |gv| Environment concepts document
=================================================

This document is a collection of relatively independent essays on various topics
related to the |gv|. It is a temporary document and eventually each
of these essays will form a chapter in one or more documents that will describe
what the |gv| is all about. It is a bit like a blog as essays are
added in random order as thoughts occur to me. In the meantime, this document
provides a home for these essays. The essays will be used to help drive the
conceptualization of each of the applications that will form part of the
application offering of the |gv|.
